The effect of an earthquake will depend on many factors and even the dependence on distance to source is very complex. However, after a bit of background research, Brandon has come up with a simple formula which hopefully at least gives a very crude estimate of relative effect of a quake with a particular magnitude and depth on a surface location at a known surface distance from the quake's epicenter. The calculated effective magnitude of an earthquake will be less that the source magnitude, for instance a magnitude 9 quake at a depth of 100km (which is likely to be extremely destructive, would have an effective magnitude of 5 at its epicentre (directly above the source) and 3.585 at a point on the earth surface 500km away from the epicenter."

        "\n",
        "* The calculation of this function is computationally intensive. For prelimiary testing you might use smaller data sets by, say only using cities in one country. \n",
        "\n",
        "* There are many optimisations that can be done to reduce the computational cost of finding the endangered cities. For example, calculating `epicenter_magnitude` enables weaker earthquakes to be ignifed withought the need to determine their distance from every city on earth. It may also be useful to not that when calcuating the effective magnitude of a given quake (with a specific depth) at different locations, the value always decreases as surface distance from the quake increases. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Remember that the autograder will run your actual code, so will probably take a while to grade this function. However, it only runs the function once and then performs 3 different tests on the value that is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The autograder will run on a presaved set of quakes (so the test is the same for all submissions). However, your code should run on any version of `all_day.csv` that you download from the USGS live feed."
